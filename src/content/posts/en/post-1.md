I’ve just renewed my personal website. Until now, I’d been operating under the name “Minase Hiro,” but I decided to start using my real name, Hiroyuki Iwasaki, as well. Consequently, I’ve also changed the site name to reflect this update.

Along with that, I migrated the site—which I had long been running on **Next.js + Vercel**—to a combination of [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) and [**Fly**](https://fly.io/). My goal is to achieve a simpler, lighter, and faster setup that requires less maintenance. I plan to continue making updates as needed and keep the site running smoothly.

Thank you for your continued support!
