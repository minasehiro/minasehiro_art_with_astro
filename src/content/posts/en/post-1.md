I’ve just renewed my personal website.
I migrated the site—which I had long been running on **Next.js + Vercel**—to a combination of [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) and [**Fly**](https://fly.io/). My goal is to achieve a simpler, lighter, and faster setup that requires less maintenance. I plan to continue making updates as needed and keep the site running smoothly.

Thank you for your continued support!
